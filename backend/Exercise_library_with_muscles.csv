Chester Step Test,,"To conduct this test, you will require:
A 15-30cm high bench or step
Stopwatch
Metronome or cadence tape
Heart rate monitor
Borg 6-20 perceived exertion table
An assistant
The box height is determined as follows:
15cm - is generally suitable for those over 40 years of age who take little or no regular physical exercise and for those under-40's who are moderately overweight. 
20cm - is generally suitable for those under 40 years of age who take little or no regular physical exercise and for those under-40's who are moderately overweight. 
25cm - is generally suitable for those over 40 years of age who regularly take physical exercise with moderately vigorous exertion. 
30cm - generally suitable for those under 40 years of age who regularly take physical exercise with moderately vigorous exertion
How to conduct the test
Before starting the test, the assistant needs to record:
The athlete's Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) - use 220-age
The athlete's 80% of Maximum Heart Rate (MHR80) - use MHR x 0.8
The Chester Step Test is conducted as follows:
The assistant explains to the athlete the test requirements.
You will step up and down onto the box in time with the metronome. 
Every 2-minutes, the metronome will be increased by five steps/minute. 
At every 2-minutes, I will record your heart rate and ask you to tell me the Borg rating for your perceived exertion, and if your heart rate is higher than your MHR80 or your perceived exertion level is above a specific value, then the test will end.
The test will end after 10 minutes of stepping
Continue stepping while I record your heart rate and ask for your perceived exertion level
The assistance checks the athlete's understanding of the test requirements.

Set the metronome to 15 beats/minute
The athlete steps up and down, one foot at a time, onto the box for 2 minutes 
After 2 minutes, set the metronome to 20 beats/min
The assistant records the athlete's heart rate (HR1)
The athlete identifies their perceived exertion value on the Borg Scale
If the heart rate is higher than the athlete's MHR80 value or their perceived exertion value is higher than 14, then stop the test

The athlete steps up and down, one foot at a time, onto the box for 2 minutes
After 2 minutes, set the metronome to 25 beats/min
The assistant records the athlete's heart rate (HR2)
The athlete identifies their perceived exertion value on the Borg Scale
If the heart rate is higher than the athlete's MHR80 value or their perceived exertion value is higher than 14, then stop the test

The athlete steps up and down, one foot at a time, onto the box for 2 minutes
After 2 minutes, set the metronome to 30 beats/min
The assistant records the athlete's heart rate (HR3)
The athlete identifies their perceived exertion value on the Borg Scale
If the heart rate is higher than the athlete's MHR80 value or their perceived exertion value is higher than 14, then stop the test

The athlete steps up and down, one foot at a time, onto the box for 2 minutes
After 2 minutes, set the metronome to 35 beats/min
The assistant records the athlete's heart rate (HR4)
The athlete identifies their perceived exertion value on the Borg Scale
If the heart rate is higher than the athlete's MHR80 value or their perceived exertion value is higher than 14, then stop the test

The athlete steps up and down, one foot at a time, onto the box for 2 minutes
